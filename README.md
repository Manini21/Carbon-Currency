# Carbon · Currency

> *"Someone turned the planet's breath into currency."*

A scroll-driven, data-first investigation into the global carbon credit market — built as an immersive web experience.

## What it is

Not a dashboard. Not a report.

A cinematic deep-dive that walks through what a carbon credit actually is, who profits, what the data shows across 30 years and 6 countries — and what it can't tell us.

## What's inside

- **Scale of 1 ton** — a visual sense of what CO₂ actually means before any numbers
- **Market anatomy** — who makes money, and how verified those claims are
- **Personal footprint calculator** — lifestyle inputs, real-time CO₂ estimate
- **Reality check** — claimed forest absorption vs. actual global emissions
- **Longitudinal data (1995–2024)** — 6 countries, real dataset, no extrapolation
- **Analytical perspective** — correlation vs. causation, honestly
