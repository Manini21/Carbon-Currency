It covers large emitting facilities, with the ability for lower emitting facilities to opt in to the regulation. \n \nCovered entities must reduce their emissions intensity (emissions per unit of production) by a set percentage each year. The reduction requirement is based on a facility\u2019s average emissions intensity over a three-year historic period or compared to a sector-specific benchmark. Covered entities that outperform their targets generate emissions performance credits (EPCs), which can be sold or used in future compliance years. Those that exceed their limits are required to provide compensation by either (1) purchasing EPCs from other covered facilities, (2) paying into the TIER fund to purchase a fund credit for each tonne of excess emissions, or (3) purchasing emission offset credits generated within Alberta under an approved offset protocol or sequestration credits.

Smaller conventional oil and gas facilities can aggregate and opt-in to the regulation. Lower emitting facilities (those emitting 2,000 tonnes CO2e or more per year) can opt-in to the regulation.\n\nAlberta\u2019s TIER system directly covers approximately 60% of Alberta\u2019s emissions.

In some cases, facilities can also apply to average their emissions over a longer period or borrow from a future year.  \n \nThe Safeguard Mechanism was introduced in 2016 but had not been classified as a baseline-and-credit system as no tradeable permits were issued.

        "description":"Austria launched its national emissions certificate trading system (Nationales Emissionszertifikatehandelsgesetz \u2013 NEHG) for fossil fuels not already covered by the EU ETS in October 2022.  \n \nAlthough the NEHG does not establish a carbon tax, the carbon pricing instrument follows in central parts the logic of existing energy taxes (fuel tax, coal tax, and natural gas tax). Thus, if a certain event is taxable under the existing energy taxes regime, an obligation to buy allowances arises under the NEHG. Taxable events are the production, import, or release of energy products from a tax warehouse in Austria or the supply of coal and natural gas to consumers. In practice, only a limited number of energy distributors and oil companies are subject to the NEHG 2022.\n \nThe NEHG aims to cover emissions outside the EU ETS, encompassing predominantly emissions in the buildings and transport sectors. Between 2022 and 2025, the system will operate with an annually increasing fixed price and a flexible cap, such that more allowances will be available for entities if needed. The NEHG is being phased in gradually. The system has been designed in line with the reduction targets for non-EU ETS sectors as defined by the \u201cEuropean Effort Sharing Regulation\u201d (ESR). The system may eventually transfer into the EU ETS 2. ",
        "recent_developments":"Austria is preparing for its NEHG to replace its national ETS with the EU ETS 2. Austria's request to \"opt-in\" sectors not covered in the European system was approved in December 2024. The Austria ETS will therefore conclude in December 2026",

This essentially concerns the following fossil energy sources: petrol, gasoil (diesel), heating oil, natural gas, liquefied gas, coal, and kerosene. Fuels in admixture with biogenic fuels receive a lower emissions factor than purely fossil fuels. ENtities that would be liable for less than 1 tonne of CO2e per year are excluded.

The PNMC lays out the basis for a carbon pricing regulation and is currently being reviewed, with a view to updating it based on the commitments assumed under the Paris Agreement. \n \nBetween 2016 and 2020, as part of its activities under the World Bank\u2019s Partnership for Market Readiness, the government carried out studies on the possible implementation of market instruments to meet its emissions targets and reduce overall mitigation costs.  The federal government's proposal for the establishment of the Brazilian Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading System (Sistema Brasileiro de Com\u00e9rcio de Emiss\u00f5es de Gases de Efeito Estufa, SBCE) was guided by the recommendations of the PMR Brazil project, which indicated the adoption of a cap-and-trade scheme as the most desirable carbon pricing option within the PNMC. \n \nUnder draft bill (Projeto de Lei, PL) \u201cPL 412\/2022\u201d the government proposal was approved with minor modifications by the Senate in October 2023. Under draft bill \u201c2148\/2015\u201d, the Chamber of Deputies modified and approved the establishment of the SBCE in late December 2023. The reviewed proposal will be sent back to the Senate for new appreciation under PL 2148\/2015, and the National Congress is expected to approve it in 2024. \n \nPL 2148\/2015 would establish the governance framework and the legal foundation for obligations by covered entities, with key design elements (such as scope, cap, and allocation) to be determined in the coming years.\n",

The CleanBC Program for Industry had been in place since April 2019 and included the CleanBC Industrial Incentive Program (CIIP) and the CleanBC Industry Fund (CIF); the CIIP will be discontinued, and the CIF is under review and will continue under the new mechanism. The B.C. OBPS follows the Canadian federal carbon price path and ensures a price incentive for industrial emitters to reduce GHG emissions through a performance-based system. Facilities that emit under their annual emission limit earn credits. For facilities that emit over their emission limit, the B.C. OBPS provides flexible compliance options to meet compliance obligations. Flexible payment options include using earned credits, B.C. offsets, or making a direct payment. Banking is allowed.

The federal backstop system consists of two components: a regulatory charge on fuels, and a baseline-and-credit ETS for emissions-intensive and trade-exposed industrial facilities called the Output-Based Pricing System (OBPS).\n\nTo comply with the national system, provinces need to implement systems that meet the minimum national carbon price.

These include Chile\u2019s NDC, Long-Term Climate Strategy, Climate Change Financial Strategy, and sectoral mitigation and adaptation plans. \n\nArticle 14 of the law mandates the Ministry of Environment to specify GHG emissions limits set by technology, sector, or activity. GHG emissions limits may be set as emissions benchmarks for individual installations or in aggregate, for a group of installations or a sector. If set in aggregate, GHG emissions limits could be akin to a cap. According to Article 15, installations that perform better than their benchmark will have their surplus emissions reductions certified, which may then be used by other regulated entities for compliance with their respective emissions limits. \n\nThe specific design of the emissions limits system is not yet defined and could be implemented either as an ETS or a tradable performance standard. In November 2023, the Ministry of Environment published the \u201cDraft Rules for the Development of GHG Emissions and Short-Lived Climate Pollutant Limits\u201d for public consultation. The document specifies procedures and characteristics of the emission limits to be developed under the Framework Law.\n\nBased on Article 37 of the Law, which provides a basis for the development of market-based, fiscal, and financial instruments to address the negative impacts of GHG emissions, the country\u2019s \u201c2022-2026 Energy Agenda\u201d states that a pilot ETS project for the energy sector will be developed. Work around this will be supported by the World Bank\u2019s Partnership for Market Implementation.\n\nChile has had a carbon tax in place since 2017. The country\u2019s \u201cLong-Term Climate Strategy\u201d, presented in October 2021, specifies that Chile will set an increasing trajectory for its carbon price between 2025 and 2030. It also specifies that the country seeks to have an integral carbon pricing portfolio to deliver coherent and predictable price signals. In line with this, the government launched its \u201cNational Energy Policy by 2050\u201d, which states that carbon prices in Chile should reach USD 35\/tCO2e by 2030 and USD 80\/tCO2e by 2040.",
        "recent_developments":"In March 2024, the \"Rules for the Development of GHG Emissions Standards and Short-Lived Climate Pollutant Limits\" were approved by Chile's Council of Ministers for Sustainability and Climate Change. This sets the procedures for setting emissions limits, and a public consultation concluded in early 2025. \n\nThe draft Green Hydrogen Action Plan foresee a pilot ETS for the energy sector to commence operations in 2026.

Covered entities must surrender allowances for all their covered emissions, and allocation is based on intensity, with allowances freely allocated using benchmarks and based on actual production levels. Compliance obligations are currently limited and vary between different types of power generation. The system\u2019s coverage will expand to other sectors over time. \n \nThe national ETS builds on the experience of pilot carbon markets implemented in eight regions.

It proposes expanding the ETS to also cover GHG Emissions from iron and steel, cement, and aluminum industries, over two phases. Phase 1 (2024 to 2026) aims to familiarize companies in these sectors with the national ETS and enhance emissions data quality. Companies will start to surrender allowances for emissions of 2024 by December 2025. Phase 2 (starting in 2027) aims to tighten and further improve the functioning of the system. This scope expansion, as being approved, brings an additional 1,500 companies into the Chinese national ETS, increasing the system\u2019s emissions coverage by 3 billion tCO2e. Further details, including on allowance allocation methods, are expected to be published in the future.\n\nIn October 2024, the MEE released the allocation plan and compliance work plan for the power sector for 2023 and 2024.

The Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development (Minambiente) will determine the number of allowances in line with Colombia\u2019s national mitigation targets. Minambiente is also in charge of allocation, which will take place primarily via auctions. Non-compliance is to be punishable by a fine of up to double the auction price. Auction revenues, as updated by Article 262 of Law 2294 of 2023, will now be allocated to the \u201cFund for Life and Biodiversity\u201d (formerly the \u201cFund for Sustainability and Climate Resilience\u201d). These funds are designated for purposes set by the national carbon tax, as well as for administering the PNCTE and the Mandatory Emissions Report under Law 2169 of 2021. The Climate Change law also includes crediting provisions: voluntary actions of non-regulated entities that generate GHG emissions reductions or removals may be issued allowances if they are verified, certified, and registered in the National Emission Reductions Registry (Registro nacional de reducci\u00f3n de emisiones de GEI \u2013 Renare), and deemed eligible for the program.\nThe PNCTE will complement Colombia's revised carbon tax, according to Resolution 12 of 2023 by the National Directorate of Taxes and Customs. The 2018 \u201cClimate Change Management Law\u201d states that the government may recognize tonnes paid through the carbon tax as part of the compliance obligation of regulated entities under the PNCTE. \nThe ETS design is currently being analyzed by the government. The 2021 \u201cClimate Action Law\u201d (Ley de Acci\u00f3n Clim\u00e1tica) sets a goal to fully implement the ETS by 2030. This has also set an obligation for legal persons to report direct and indirect GHG emissions, following criteria to be set by Minambiente.

The EU ETS is currently in its fourth trading phase (2021 to 2030). Every year, covered entities must surrender allowances for their emissions under the EU ETS.

The reforms increased the ambition and expanded the scope of the EU ETS to maritime transport, and introduced a new, separate emissions trading system for buildings, road transport and additional sectors (called EU ETS 2). The reforms also established a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism to address the risk of carbon leakage from specific sectors under the EU ETS (as an alternative to free allocation). ",

        "description":"In July 2021, the European Commission proposed the \u201cFit for 55\u201d package of reforms to align EU climate and energy policy with the objectives of the \u201cEuropean Green Deal\u201d, most importantly the ambitious 2030 climate target of reducing net emissions to at least 55% below the 1990 level. The package included important amendments to the EU ETS framework, including a proposal to extend emissions trading to new sectors. These amendments were adopted in the first half of 2023 and are now in force. \n \nA new, separate emissions trading system (ETS 2) will be established for emissions from fuels used for combustion in buildings, road transport and additional sectors (mainly small industry not covered by the existing EU ETS). The ETS 2 will complement other policies of the European Green Deal in the covered sectors, helping Member States achieve their emission reduction targets under the \u201cEffort Sharing Regulation\u201d (Regulation (EU) 2018\/842).   \n \nThe ETS 2 is based on the \u2018cap-and-trade\u2019 principle. It will cover emissions upstream, meaning the obligation to surrender allowances will fall on the fuel suppliers rather than end-consumers. The ETS 2 cap will be set to bring emissions down by 42% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.  \n \nThe ETS 2 is due to become fully operational in 2027. As a first step, the monitoring and reporting of emissions from the covered sectors will start in 2025. To necessary rules were adopted in October 2023.  \n  \nA share of revenues from the ETS 2 will be used to support vulnerable households and micro-enterprises through a dedicated Social Climate Fund, created as part of the \u201cFit for 55\u201d package. Member States will be required to use the remaining ETS 2 revenues for climate action and social measures.  ",

        "description":"The government of India introduced an amendment to the \u201cEnergy Conservation Act, 2001\u201d, providing a legal basis for the establishment of a Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) and issuance of carbon credit certificates. The amendment bill, incorporating these provisions, was passed in the Lower House (Lok Sabha) in August 2022, adopted, and subsequently passed in the Upper House (Rajya Sabha) in December 2022. The amendment bill provides the legal basis to establish a domestic carbon market (ICM) and grants the power to issue carbon credit certificates (CCCs) for the reduction of emissions.  \n \nFollowing passage of the amendment, the government began work on the institutional and regulatory framework for the CCTS. The draft notification was published for stakeholder consultation in March 2023. Based on received comments, the notification was revised and officially issued in June 2023. \n\nUnder the compliance mechanism, obligated entities will receive an annual emissions intensity target covering a three-year period, denominated in tCO2e per unit of product. New emissions intensity targets will be announced every three years to enable longer-term planning for covered entities. If an obligated entity overachieves its emissions intensity target, it can earn CCCs based on the difference between the achieved and the targeted emissions intensity. Entities that fail to achieve their targets will have to surrender\/purchase a corresponding number of CCCs to ensure compliance and this will be achieved by facilitating trading among the obligated entities on a registry\/trading platform. In this way the scheme will operate as a baseline-and-credit emissions trading scheme. \n \nThe CCTS scope will include both direct emissions from fuel combustion and industrial processes, as well as indirect emissions from electricity and heat consumption. It will cover CO2, and perfluorocarbons (PFCs).  \n \nThe CCTS will be based on the existing Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme \u2013 a mandatory energy efficiency scheme covering more than 1,000 entities from 13 energy-intensive sectors \u2013 that should be gradually transitioned into a compliance carbon market.\n\nIt is expected that a phased transition from the current PAT scheme to the compliance mechanism under CCTS will begin in 2024. The compliance mechanism will be jointly managed by the Ministry of Power, the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, and the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE). \n \nIn December 2023, the government amended the CCTS notification, introducing provisions for the offset mechanism to support non-obligated entities and promote mitigation efforts, encompassing  a comprehensive approach for GHG reduction. The government is actively working to operationalize both the compliance and offset mechanisms. ",

Plans for this are outlined in the Basic Plan for the \u201cGreen Transformation (GX) Policy\u201d, Japan\u2019s ten-year decarbonization strategy. \nThe GX-ETS started as a voluntary baseline-and-credit system in 2023. Almost 570 companies, making up more than 50% of national emissions, participate. Under the GX-ETS, J-Credits (see below) are traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. \n \nThe GX-ETS is expected to transition to a mandatory ETS from 2026 after its first compliance deadline. Upper and lower price limits are planned to be introduced. From 2033, auctioning is anticipated to be introduced for high-emitting entities in the power sector. Separately, a carbon levy is anticipated to be introduced from 2028 on fossil fuel importers. \n\nJapan is actively participating in international carbon markets. Its Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) is a bilateral scheme to incentivize decarbonizing technologies and mitigation actions in 28 partner countries.

It is looking into the implementation of carbon pricing instruments such as a carbon tax and an ETS in Malaysia and is covering several key aspects such as policy and market design frameworks, national registry development, and alignment with international standards. It is expected to conclude in 2024.  \n \nAt the subnational level, in November 2023 the state of Sarawak passed a climate bill that includes provisions to introduce mandatory emissions thresholds for certain industrial emitters. According to Sarawak officials, covered entities will be required to report their annual emissions to the state regulator and to set themselves binding emissions thresholds. Entities that fail to do so will be subject to a carbon tax, the rate of which is still to be determined by the state Cabinet.  ",

Maryland\u2019s power sector is currently regulated by the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), but the 2023 plan includes direction for the state to consider expanding to an economy-wide cap-and-invest program. It cites potential for additional revenues to be invested in clean energy projects, consumer rebates, and other decarbonization programs. In 2024, the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) is exploring how this coverage of additional emission sources could work. \n \nIn June 2023, the economy-wide cap-and-invest program was proposed by MDE and the University of Maryland\u2019s Center for Global Sustainability as a supportive policy to achieve Maryland\u2019s 2031 target of a 60% reduction in GHG emissions from 2006 levels. The proposal anticipated the program achieving 4.8 MtCO2e of emissions reductions by 2031. ",

The system applies to the same sectors and gases as the federal system, and follows the same price trajectory, rising CAD 15 (USD 11.11) each year until 2030, resulting in a price of CAD 170 (USD 125.93) per tCO2e in 2030.   \n",

The NZ ETS was originally conceived as a nested system under the Kyoto Protocol, with full links to international carbon markets. However, as of June 1 2015, the NZ ETS became a domestic-only system. In 2024, the cap is 27.9 MtCO2e. \n\nExtensive legislative reforms of the NZ ETS were implemented in 2020.",

The cap was reduced from 27.9 million in 2024 to 19.1 million in 2025. The auction reserve price floor for 2025 is set at NZD 69, with a first CCR trigger price of NZD 193.",

It is an intensity-based ETS for large industrial emitters, in which each covered entity must surrender compliance units for emissions that exceed each facility\u2019s annual emissions limit. Each facility\u2019s annual emissions limit is based on a combination of historical emission intensity, actual production activity data, and an annually decreasing reduction factor. Special provisions are in place for offshore petroleum facilities which must reduce emissions by an equivalent percentage in absolute terms (regardless of production). The system applies to the same sectors and GHGs as the federal Canadian system, and follows the same price trajectory, rising CAD 15 (USD 11.11) each year until 2030, resulting in a price of CAD 170 (USD 125) per tCO2e in 2030.  \n",

The Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination (MoCC&EC) has received support from the UNFCCC and the World Bank in developing a MRV roadmap, establishing a domestic ETS framework, and in building a communication strategy for carbon pricing. The ongoing work on establishing a registry and MRV system has progressed to the implementation phase. \n \nPakistan launched the National Committee on Establishment of Carbon Markets (NCEC) in December 2019, which coordinated ministerial activities on carbon pricing. Among other responsibilities, the one-year committee was tasked with assessing the role and scope of carbon markets in delivering Pakistan\u2019s NDC and identifying opportunities for and challenges to improving emissions data. The NCEC reviewed existing carbon market designs, deliberated with national stakeholders, and coordinated information-sharing and capacity-building activities. The MoCC&EC is currently advancing the work in these areas under the World Bank\u2019s PMI program where the initial mapping exercise has led to the implementation of activities contributing to four broad outcomes. The country will initiate work on: 1) domestic carbon pricing policy; 2) international carbon market to operationalize Article 6; 3) an MRV framework; and 4) knowledge management\/capacity building under the current support in next five years. \n \nBesides a domestic ETS, Pakistan aims to launch credit-based trading mechanisms linked to international carbon markets, which would enable it to supply offset credits to partner countries. Policy guidelines are being drafted to provide a roadmap for carbon trading in international markets. This includes the guidelines for developing emission reduction projects and protocols for corresponding adjustment.",

        "description":"In October 2019, Pennsylvania\u2019s Governor Tom Wolf signed an executive order directing the state\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to develop and present to the Environmental Quality Board (EQB) a proposal for an ETS covering CO2 emissions from the electric power sector and its linkage to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).\n  \nIn April 2022, the final regulation to establish an ETS in Pennsylvania and to participate in RGGI was published. It set a base cap of 78 million short tons (70.8 MtCO2) if Pennsylvania was a participating state of RGGI as of 1 January 2022. The cap decreases by 3% annually to 58.1 million short tons (52.7 MtCO2) in 2030.\n\nThe regulation includes the implementation of both emissions containment and cost containment reserves, as well as quarterly auctions to allocate allowances. It includes additional features such as set-aside accounts (accounts from which allowances may be transferred to the accounts of regulated units or retired on their behalf) for waste coal and cogeneration units (including combined heat and power systems), and a limited exemption for cogeneration units that supply less than 15% of their total energy to the electricity grid. \n",
        "recent_developments":"In September 2024, Pennsylvania's state senate approved SB1058 to repeal the regulation establishing an ETS (and participation in RGGI), but the bill is under consideration by the House of Representatives.",

RGGI\u2019s development was based on the \u201c2005 RGGI Memorandum of Understanding\u201d (MOU) and on the \u201c2006 RGGI Model Rule\u201d. Through statutes or regulations based on the Model Rule, each state then established individual CO2budget trading programs.\n \nRGGI covers power sector emissions in participating states. In 2020, it covered around 14% of the aggregate participant states\u2019 emissions; in 2021, 228 facilities were covered by the state regulations. The aggregate cap will decrease by 30% compared to 2020 between 2021 and 2030. Under the ETS, covered entities must surrender allowances for all their covered emissions. Covered entities obtain most of their allowances through regular auctions, while some states have \u201cset-aside\u201d accounts from which they may transfer a limited number of allowances to entities\u2019 compliance accounts.  ",

However, a Viginia circuit court decision in November 2024 deemed the repeal unlawful. RGGI has undergone two review processes that updated the Model Rule and enshrined tighter caps and adjustments to system design. RGGI\u2019s third review process is currently ongoing. In September 2024 RGGI states released an exploratory scenario with new cap reductions trajectories, with a steeper decline in the cap from 2027-2033 followed by a lessening decline from 2033 to 2037.

The overall aim of the roadmap is to ensure that Sakhalin achieves carbon neutrality by 2025, and includes plans for a pilot carbon trading system.  \n \nIn 2022, the State Duma approved a \u201cFederal Law on Conducting an Experiment to Limit GHG Emissions in Selected Federal States of the Russian Federation\u201d, introducing mandatory emissions reporting and verification requirements for regulated entities and obliging them to comply with the allocated emissions allowances. The law also sets a legal basis for allowance circulation between entities. \n\nThe Sakhalin government approved a list of 50 regulated entities for the new ETS, emitting at least 20,000 tCO2 per year, in 2022, and a carbon registry started operating in test mode in September that year. The first compliance period is set to start in 2024. Covered entities will have to surrender allowances for all their covered emissions, and allocation is expected to be based on free allocation.  \n \nIn 2023, regulated entities submitted their first verified emissions reports for 2022, which became the basis for setting individual caps for 35 entities in September 2023.

The ETS started in 2008 with a five-year phase during which companies could voluntarily join as an alternative to facing the Switzerland carbon tax (CO2 levy on fossil fuels). Starting from 2013, the ETS became mandatory for large energy-intensive industries and medium-sized industries could voluntarily join. Participants in the ETS continue to be exempted from the CO2 levy. On January 1, 2020, the linking of the Swiss and EU ETS came into force.  Ratification of the agreement by the EU and Switzerland was announced on December 12, 2019 and followed legislative revisions required for the Swiss ETS to be compatible with the EU ETS and comply with the agreement. With the linking agreement now in effect, covered entities in the Switzerland ETS can use allowances from the EU ETS for compliance, and vice versa. However, the two systems run separate auctions. The revised \u2018Ordinance on the Reduction of CO2 Emissions (CO2 Ordinance),\u2019 was adopted in November 2020, which embedded the new legal base for the Swiss ETS into the partially revised \u201cCO2 Act\u201d \u2013 the core framework of Switzerland\u2019s climate legislation \u2013 that entered into force in January 2021.\n",
        "recent_developments":"After a revision of the CO2 Act failed to pass a referendum in June 2021, the Swiss Parliament extended the current CO2 Act to 2024. This included the target to reduce emissions by 1.5% per year compared to 1990 levels. In November 2022, the Swiss Federal Council published a new proposal for a revision of the CO2 Act that covers the period from 2025 to 2030, including Switzerland\u2019s 50% emission reduction target for 2030. The proposal includes provisions to align the Swiss ETS with the revised EU ETS.\n \nIn November 2023, the EU and Switzerland concluded the 2024 emission allowance transfer arrangements between their systems. From January 2024, daily transfers, with exceptions for specific dates, replaced the previous twice-weekly schedule. Details on the 2025 arrangements are anticipated by the end of 2024. ",

Allowance transfers between the EU and Swiss registries are generally executed bi-monthly on pre-announced dates. \n\n\nIn 2024, allowance transfers between the EU and Swiss registries will be executed on a daily basis, with specific exceptions for certain dates. This arrangement follows an agreement reached in November 2023 by the Joint Committee overseeing the EU and Swiss linking agreement. The 2024 arrangements cover a 12-month period, with information on 2025 arrangements expected before the end of 2024. "

The 2018 \u201cNational Reform Plan\u201d mandated the Thai government to begin developing such instruments. The Emission Trading Scheme, Carbon Tax on Products, and Crediting Mechanism are some of the potential economic instruments to be implemented; further details on these will be provided in the policy and legislative processes that follow the development of the framework for the \u201cClimate Change Act\u201d. The Department of Climate Change and Environment (DCCE) is currently drafting the act for the public hearing process as well as working on implementing the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA). The final draft is expected to be submitted for cabinet and parliamentary approval in 2024 to 2025. \n \nIn 2013, the Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization (TGO) began developing an MRV system and basic trading infrastructures for the Thailand Voluntary Emissions Trading Scheme (Thailand V-ETS).  This voluntary pilot project aims to develop and test MRV systems, cap-setting and allocation procedures, and trading infrastructure for 12 GHG-intensive sectors. Targets are set for each sector based on their average emissions intensity in the base years of 2012 to 2013. Both direct and indirect emissions are covered. As a voluntary system, allowances are provided for free based on MRV reporting. Based on TGO\u2019s feasibility study and pilot implementation test cases, covered entities may be allowed to use offset credits from Thailand\u2019s domestic crediting mechanism, Thailand Voluntary Emission Reduction (T-VER) credits, to meet up to 15% of their compliance obligations. Supporting these initiatives, TGO regularly conducts capacity building activities to engage key stakeholders across Thailand. \n \nSince 2021, TGO has collaborated with the Eastern Economic Corridor Office of Thailand to develop a pilot ETS in its Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) region. The project aimed to conduct engagement, build up capacity on ETS implementation for pilot organizations, and provide technical assistance on T-VER project development. Several pilot organizations fulfilled their ETS Capacity building program, 12 in 2022 and 11 in 2023.",

These include the submission of an Updated First NDC, which has explicit references to the Turkish Emission Trading System (TR ETS), and an announcement from the Directorate of Climate Change (DoCC) during COP28 that a pilot ETS is planned to launch in October 2024 with the publication of the National Allocation Plan. Moreover, following its publication in the Official Gazette in December, the Grant Agreement with the World Bank PMI program supporting the implementation of the pilot ETS came into force. The program will assist T\u00fcrkiye in assessing various design options through modelling studies and provide support during the pilot as well as the first implementation phases of the new system. \n \nThese developments follow the advisory decisions of the Climate Council (a multi-stakeholder consultation event with broad participation) in 2022, which included the launch of the pilot ETS in 2024 aligned with the country\u2019s 2053 Net-Zero Target. The intention to develop an ETS has also been reflected in T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s annual Medium-Term Programs (MTPs) since 2022. Moreover, the high-level planning outlined in the 12th Turkish Development Plan (2024 to 2028) takes the year 2053 as a long-term reference in the country\u2019s green and digital transformation agenda and considers the TR ETS as an instrument of this transformation.

Issues related to climate change are addressed in Article 365 (c) Title V and in an annex to the agreement, which outlines steps for the implementation of a national ETS \n\nThe country has since established a national MRV system, with its scope partially covering activities similar to EU ETS activities, to provide a solid basis for the upcoming ETS. Since 2021, the MRV procedures as adopted in the framework law on MRV have been applied by regulated installations. To establish its ETS, Ukraine plans to develop separate legislation based on at least three years of data from the MRV system. According to a statement made by the Minister of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources in October 2023, the ETS may be launched in a pilot mode in 2025.  \n\nIn 2022, covered installations were supposed to submit first monitoring reports for 2021. However, from 2022, due to the ongoing war in the country, the MRV system is implemented on a voluntary basis.

The framework legislation also empowers MONRE to set the ETS cap and determine the method of allowance allocation. It also allows for the inclusion of domestic and international offset credits in the ETS. \n \n\u201cDecree 06\/2022\/ND-CP\u201d outlines a roadmap for the implementation of the NCM and the ETS. The decree requires facilities with annual GHG emissions above 3,000 tCO2e to submit a biennial inventory report of their emissions from 2025 onwards. The accompanying \u201cDecision 01\/2022\/QD-TTg\u201d lists the sectors and facilities with emissions inventory obligations.  \n \nDecree 06 also includes provisions for developing a national ETS, focusing initially on the steel, cement, and thermal power sectors, with a declining cap that corresponds to Vietnam\u2019s NDC. The roadmap for the ETS states that regulations and a trading platform should be in place by 2025. A pilot ETS is planned for 2027-.

It covers around 70% of the state\u2019s emissions, and its cap trajectory is consistent with the long-term target to reduce statewide emissions to 95% below 1990 levels by 2050. \n \nThe program covers around 150 entities in the energy, industrial, buildings, and transport sectors. Many of the cap-and-invest program\u2019s design elements are similar to those of California\u2019s cap-and-trade program.  Covered entities must surrender allowances for all their covered emissions. Allowances are distributed through auctioning and free allocation, with the latter based primarily on benchmarking. \n \nThe cap-and-invest program was established by the \u201cClimate Commitment Act\u201d (CCA), signed into law by Governor Jay Inslee in May 2021. ",
